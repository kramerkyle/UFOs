The UFO Finder webpage opens with the title, "The Truth Is Out There" over a photograph of the earth at night, with the lights of civilization illuminating the shot. After ufologists weigh in with a short article on "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?". Beneath this section, we arrive at a set of filters and a table with the results!
